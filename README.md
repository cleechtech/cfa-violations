$ bower install
$ node server

## Development (Front or Backend)
You have 30 minutes for the below exercise. Write a brief program in the language of your choice to summarize a simple dataset. This is a comma-delimited data file representing building code violations:

Your program should calculate the number of violations in each category, and the earliest and latest violation date for each category. You can use your preferred programming language, and decide on the presentation format of the resulting data.

## Data Science
You have 30 minutes for the below exercise. This is a comma-delimited data file representing building code violations:

Choose one:

1) Visualize this data however you see fit and tell a story of any specific trends you see. This should be a combination of a visual graph, coupled with a couple of paragraphs on your methodology, insights, and analysis.

2) Develop a predictive model that estimates when a particular violation will occur next. Your goal is to develop a framework of how this model would be created, as well as any suggestions on additional data or features that would further increase the predictability of this model.
